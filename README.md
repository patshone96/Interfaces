# Interfaces
 
Interfaces developed using JS, HTML and CSS - With ELECTRON and PHOTON. Also using Boostrap, and Xel as node modules. And express to develop REST APIs and MongoDb to store data in a non-relational DBMS. 
 


These easy projects are developed during the course of an IT course 👩‍🏫 

To try the code you just have to:

1. Download any of the folders 📁 

2. Open a terminal/ integrated terminal with the folder as the root 🌱 

3. Use the command npm install (you need to have node.js installed on your computer) 💻 

4. A node_modules folder will be created, containing all the dependencies needed 📂 

5. When the install comand finishes, use the npm start command and the app will start running! 🏃‍♀️ 🏃‍♂️ 🏃‍♀️
